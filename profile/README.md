The quantum intelligence research team investigates the interplay between Quantum and Intelligence. The quantum, especially in modalities of Q computation and Q information, is studied as the underlying automata and logic. Intelligence is studied as the software running on the quantum substrate, both as a way to better use as well as better understand quantum systems. These encompass applications like artificial general intelligence, reinforcement learning, quantum programming, causal inference, quantum machine learning, etc.

The Quantum Intellingence research team is currently embedded and affiliated to the Quantum Machine Learning research group of the Quantum Computing division of QuTech.
