# Quantum Intelligence Research Team

The quantum intelligence research team investigates the interplay between Quantum and Intelligence. The quantum, especially in modalities of Q computation and Q information, is studied as the underlying automata and logic. Intelligence is studied as the software running on the quantum substrate, as a way to use better and understand quantum systems. These encompass applications like artificial general intelligence, reinforcement learning, quantum programming, causal inference, quantum machine learning, etc.

The Quantum Intelligence research team is currently embedded and affiliated with the [Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/sections/quantum-circuits-architectures-and-technology/groups/quantum-machine-learning) research group of the Quantum Computing division of QuTech. For other projects within the group, check the [QML-Group](https://github.com/QML-Group) GitHub organization.
